# De-structuring

It is basically a javascript concept, however it is very well used in react.

Here, we are focusing on destructuring **props** and **state** in react.

Destructuring is an ES6 feature that makes it possible to unpack _objects/values from arrays_ or _properties from object into distinct variables_.

In react, destructuring props and state increases the code readability.

## Destructuring in Functional Component

An example with comments are in [Wishes.js](../src/destructuring/Wishes.js), in this file you can observe two functional components(**Wishes** and **Wish**) have been destructuring in two different ways.

## Destructuring in Class Component

An example with comments are in [Namaste.js](../src/destructuring/Namaste.js), destructuring it is quite similar to destructuring in functional component, a small difference in class component is we destructuring inside render method.

An example of destructuring an array is also include in the [Namaste.js](../src/destructuring/Namaste.js).

## Advantage of Destructuring

Any object or array could have more properties or values respectively, but using destructuring helps you to unpack only those properties or values from object and array.
