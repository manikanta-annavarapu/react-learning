## Functional Component vs Class Components

| Functional Component                                                 | Class Component                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple function                                                      | More Feature Rich                                    |
| Use function component as much as possible                           | maintain their own private data in the form of state |
| advantage of functional component is the absence of '_this_' keyword | you can develop complex UI logic                     |
|                                                                      |                                                      |
|                                                                      |                                                      |
|                                                                      |                                                      |

### About Hooks Update

Previously States and Life Cycle Hooks are only available for class components, however in the react version 16.8 or above, these features are also available for functional components.
